    <h1>My name is Alex,</h1> <p>and I'm a twenty-eight-year-old married woman with a pit bull named Ares as our fur baby. I am currently working as a student at Wake Tech, undergoing their Web and UX Design Associate's Degree program, and have been working with HTML5/CSS3 since it came out in 2008. As for why a fourteen year old girl would bother with learning a programming language? Well, when she breaks her hip and has to stay inside for practically the rest of her life, boredom was cured by making pretty webpages. Funny how it got me here now, huh?</p>
