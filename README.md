My name is Alex Algiere, you can contact me at analgiere@my.waketech.edu very easily and this account will be used to display a portfolio of web designs for my college career and more, this specific repository will be used to display the portfolio. To clone the repository, I first had to download GitHub Desktop, then once downloaded I had to locate the "+" symbol in the upper left-hand corner of the program. From there I simply had to pick 'Clone A Repository', then select the correct and only repository currently available on this account. Placing the file in my CTI110 folder, I have successfully cloned a repository.
